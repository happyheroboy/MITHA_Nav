# MITHA_Nav
This is the matlab version demo code of the paper (under review), "Image-Guided Navigation System for Minimally Invasive Total Hip Arthroplasty (MITHA) Using an Improved Position-Sensing Marker"

Four algorithms are in the uploaded Matlab file, including marker detection, instrument calibration,  instrument tracking, and point-based registration.

 1. marker detection. The "test_image.m" is the main function.
 2. instrument calibration. The "im_Triangulate.m" is the main function.
 3. instrument tracking. The "tracking.m" is the main function
 4. point-based registration. The "registration.m" is the main function.
 
All of the above functions are configured. You can run them.
